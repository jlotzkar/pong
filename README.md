"My partner and I chose to recreate Pong for our final ECE243 project. The game was written in C to work on the De1-SoC board using a VGA display and ps/2 keyboard. It can also work the CPUlator simulator. ... Photos of what the game looks like and how it works are described below.

**How to play**

Key	Location	Function
H	Title Screen	Help - takes you to more settings + instructions
2	Title Screen	Selects 2 Player Mode
1	Title Screen	Selects 1 Player Mode

You can select 3 options on the title screen. press H to get instructions, 2 to start 2-player mode, and 1 to start 1 player mode. In CPUlator, this would be achieved by typing into the ps/2 keyboard simulator with IRQ 79.

A single player mode looks the same as a 2 player mode when just recording, so no demo for that. When the game ends, the following screen is displayed."
