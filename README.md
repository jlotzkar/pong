Description

"My partner and I chose to recreate Pong for our final ECE243 project. The game was written in C to work on the De1-SoC board using a VGA display and ps/2 keyboard. It can also work the CPUlator simulator. ... Photos of what the game looks like and how it works are described below.

The Game


You can select 3 options on the title screen. press H to get instructions, 2 to start 2-player mode, and 1 to start 1 player mode. In CPUlator, this would be achieved by typing into the ps/2 keyboard simulator with IRQ 79.



Pressing H displays the following



Pressing H again takes you back to the main screen

Here is a demo of the 2player mode



And here's a demo with 2 balls. Note that this feature is only enabled for 2 player mode.



A single player mode looks the same as a 2 player mode when just recording, so no demo for that. When the game ends, the following screen is displayed."
